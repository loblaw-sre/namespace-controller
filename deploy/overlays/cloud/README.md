This serves as an example of a cloud deployment. These values are hardcoded to
the Loblaw playground project. Feel free to change these values to your own GCP
playground.

In a real deployment pipeline, you can either hard code actual values on a
new `kustomization.yaml`, or use `yq` to change the values on the fly.
